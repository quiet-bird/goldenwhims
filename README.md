## About

Urination and watersports extension for WickedWhims.

Note that GoldenWhims relies on the [Sims 4 Community Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/thesims4/mods/287), including functionality which is not yet in a public release. Until the next S4CL release, if you want to play GoldenWhims, you will have to build S4CL from its source and use the package file included within the `Release/Sims4CommunityLib` folder of its source tree.

I also recommend using Singakai's [Yellow Stream](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/161657-yellow-stream/) mod.

## Features

- An almost-invisible "pee spot" furniture object which can be placed for free. Sims with a bad enough bladder need will use these, performing WickedWhims peeing interactions on them.
- Sims which "really have to pee", if they cannot use a conventional toilet or "pee spot", will pee where they are standing as opposed to waiting until they wet themselves, unless they are snobbish.
- "Diuretic atmosphere", a lot trait. This causes all Sims on the lot to gain 5 points of bladder need every 5 seconds.
- "Overactive bladder", a buff. This causes the affected Sim's bladder need to become worse by 5 points every 5 seconds, and lasts for 8 hours. There is currently no way for this buff to happen to a Sim naturally.
- A rudimentary new female pee animation which female Sims will sometimes use instead of WickedWhim's low squat, as a proof-of-concept.
